# MIMIC-IV custom code mappings

The files in this directory were copied directly from the corresponding directory in the repository for the OHDSI conversion tool (i.e. from  
https://github.com/OHDSI/MIMIC/tree/master/custom_mapping_csv).
If running our tool after a longer break, it may be good to check that the files are still up-to-date.
